# Capstone Product Plan
The second deliverable for the capstone is your product plan.

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__: 
* Handling databases for different users.
* Web-scraping. 
* Learning more about spaced-repetition timing and how it is implemented.

1. __Problem Statement__: An easier way to collect vocabulary from native sources and review it.

1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
    - others: several SRS exist independently where users must add or download others' decks. Some are free or paid: Supermemo (paid), anki (free)
    - mine: it uses real-world information that the user decides on, they don't have to type back and forth, just click and review.
  
1. __User Personas__: Language-learning students who wish to supplement their endeavors with native material. 

1. __Trello Board__:
    - https://trello.com/b/DHbCPcc0
  
1. __Technology selections__:
    So far I have decided on: 
    - Front-end: React Web
    - Back-end: Express, Node.js, Mongo, Google Analytics, APIs
    - AWS
  
1. __Wireframes__:
    - Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors
    - I have some things on paper.

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
