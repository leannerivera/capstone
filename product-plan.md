# Capstone Product Plan
The second deliverable for the capstone is your product plan.

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__: 
* Handling databases for different users.
* Web-scraping. 
* Learning more about spaced-repetition timing and how it is implemented.

1. __Problem Statement__: A clear, concise statement describing the problem your project will solve. Re-use the problem statement from the concept write-up or update if you've made adjustments.

1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research, including:
    - several SRS exist independently where users must add or download others' decks. 
    - research from users on why these alternatives do not effectively address the problem.
    - it uses real-world information that the user decides on. 
  
1. __User Personas__: Language-learning students who wish to supplement their endeavors with native material. 

1. __Trello Board__:
    - Flesh out the feature set that you created in the conceptual delivery to get started with your Trello board
  
1. __Technology selections__:
    - Front-end
    - Back-end
    - Infrastructure - Deployment or Code
  
1. __Wireframes__:
    - Any format you may like - photos of paper, online tool and/or paper to show your instructors

## Format
Since the Product Plan is part of your final deliverable and should be included in your repository, it would be easiest to do this initial draft in a markdown format for easy transferability to GitHub.
